MonReader is a new mobile document digitization experience for the blind, for researchers and for everyone else in need for fully automatic, highly fast and high-quality document scanning in bulk.
It is composed of a mobile app and all the user needs to do is flip pages and everything is handled by MonReader: it detects page flips from low-resolution camera preview and takes a high-resolution 
picture of the document, recognizing its corners and crops it accordingly, and it dewarps the cropped document to obtain a bird's eye view, sharpens the contrast between the text and the background 
and finally recognizes the text with formatting kept intact, being further corrected by MonReader's ML powered reactor.

Dataset:

Video frames from a smart phone which are labelled as flipping and not flipping.
Clips containing flip or no flip.

Goal:

Predict if a page is being flipped or not using a single image. Predict if a series of images (clip) contains the action of flipping.
